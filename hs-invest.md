This website is meant primarily for potential investors and software developers looking for a secure and trustless way to invest in the very first DAO company that replicates the business model of traditional for-profit corporations.

While we have no means to control who invests in Horizontal Systems DAO ideally we would like to work with investors and blockchain funds which clearly understand what DAO is and how it opeartes. We encourage you to review our github repositories, the project progress, the team and in particular the DAO/DAICO smart contract implementation to make sure that everything works exactly as claimed.

- HS DAO contract: (token contract address)
- HS DAICO contract: (token sale conrtact adderss)
- HS Team contract: contract address
- HS Investors contract: contract address

**Note: The contracts are going to be available on Ethereum Blockchain after the token sale has been launched. The token sale will be launched after the very first product, a [BANK Wallet](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/2), is live.**

Horizontal Systems DAO shares are represented as HSYS tokens. The amount of tokens determines the amount of influence token holder has over the company.

The process through which the tokens are sold is called [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained), which was initially proposed by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), a founder of Ethereum blockchain. 


Unlike the traditional ICO models, the DAICO model offers significant adavntage and guatantess security of invested funds:

- transparrent model
- nearly zero risk
- backed by open source code
- fully transapparent workflow

The investors are the ones who get to split company profits and control the finances. 

As we release dApps we aim to integrate monetization features into every decentralized product we develop. The apps will include various extra paid features on top of the standard functionality. 

Unlocking these features will cost some money (charged in crypto) that would be directly deposited (in real time) to unchangeable investor-controlled smart contract which is designed to store and distribute profits from all released products.
