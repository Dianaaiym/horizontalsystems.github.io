This website is meant to be a guide for potential investors and software developers interested in becoming one of the decentralized owners of the independent for-profit DAO company.

While existing shareholders have no means to control who invests in Horizontal Systems DAO we invite parties which understand what this DAO is and how it operates. 

We urge potential investors to read the information provided here and then verify that information by looking up the underlying smart contracts for [Horizontal Systems DAO](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/daico-smart-contracts  ) on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Horizontal Systems DAO contract address: _to be provided after official launch_**


<h2><center>Investors (Shareholders)</h2></center>

Horizontal Systems DAO shares are represented as HSDAO tokens. Anyone owning HSDAO tokens is automatically a shareholder and able to exercise the influence over the DAO.

The amount of tokens determines the amount of influence token holder has over the company. The investors are the ones who get to split company profits and control the finances. 

Tokens in circulation: _to be provided after official launch_


<h2><center>Token Sale</h2></center>

The process through which the tokens are sold is called [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained), which was initially proposed by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), a founder of Ethereum blockchain. 

Unlike the traditional ICO models, the DAICO model offers significant advantage and guarantees security of invested funds:

- transparent model and nearly zero risk
- backed by open source code
- allows investors to collectively dissolve the company and return the invested funds.


<h2><center>Why Invest</h2></center>

As we release dApps we aim to integrate monetization features into every decentralized product we develop. The apps will include various extra paid features on top of the standard functionality. 

Unlocking these features will cost some money (charged in crypto) that would be directly deposited (in real time) to unchangeable investor-controlled smart contract which is designed to store and distribute profits from all released products. 

As we build Horizontal Systems DApps we are releasing several software repositories to the crypto ecosystem enabling developers worldwide to build branded decentralized wallets, exchanges and other blockchain-powered DApps.

The current milestones and progress on each milestone can be seen under the [Projects section](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects) on Github. Note that while the projects may seem unrelated for the most part they are closely interdependent.
