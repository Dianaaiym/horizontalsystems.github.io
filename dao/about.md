Horizontal Systems governed by its shareholders via digital smart contracts and is driven by talented software engineers in a decentralized, transparent, immutable and incorruptable manner. These smart contracts are designed from the very start to ensure that governance and operational protocols work as expected and can't be changed in the future.

<br/>

Anyone may become a shareholder of the Horizontal Systems DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless, reliable and transparent manner. 

Shareholders excercise full control of the company finances and control who gets to head the development team and growth strategy. Should there ever be a need for it, the shareholders can dissolve the Horizontal Systems DAO and split the company's financial assets between shareholders.

The development Team is open to any capable blockchain developers. Anyone may become a contributor and subsequently an equally compensated full member of the Horizontal Systems development team.

## How It Works

1. Shareholders buy a stake in Horizontal Systems DAO via [DAICO fundraising model](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained). Shareholders maintain full control of profits and raised funds. They also get to control who leads the development team.

2. Horizontal Systems DAO employs developers that build commercial Decentralized Apps. All generated profits generated by DApps are managed by smart contracts which distribute these funds between shareholders.

3. Horizontal Systems keeps the entire software production workflow including to-do tasks, upcoming milestones, team communication and discussions on [Github](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/). Every single line of code powering Horizontal Systems DAO incl. its products is open-source providing any software engineer an easy way to verify that our apps work as claimed. Anyone is able to monitor the team, work being done, every single code change, close to real-time!

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code used in DAO is open to public for scrutiny. All DAO rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain and operartional prootocols are enforced by digitally coded autinomous smart contracts.
