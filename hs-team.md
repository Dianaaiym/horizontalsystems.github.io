>Now, in software, and it used ot be the case in hardware, the difference between the average software developer and the best is 50:1; Maybe even 100:1. Very few things in life are like this...

At Horizontal Systems we are strong proponents of compact and productive teams. Having a compact and yet comprehensive team is one of our core strengths.

There were 14 full time developers working for the company at the time of launch. While anyone from public may apply to become a developer we intend to keep the team size small and keep the future spots exclusively for software architects.

Having a compact team allows us to maintain efficient workflow and keep building quality libraries and products at aggresive pace. With the current size we are fairly confident that our current work pace allows the team to outperform a 100+ people companies working in the field.
