Horizontal Systems DAO is a decentralized autonomous company which is governed by a pool of independent governors and driven by software developers worldwide.

### How It Works

1. shareholders [buy a stake](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-dapps) in Horizontal Systems DAO via [DAICO fundraising model](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained)
2. shareholders always remain in control of DAO's profits and initially raised funds
3. DAO employs a team of contractors (developers) to build commercial DApps
4. DAO pays contractors team a regular salary from raised funds
5. DApps built by team are free but come with premium in-app features
6. app users can unlock these features by paying using available crypto balance
7. all user payments are collected and stored in DAO's independent smart contracts
8. shareholders initiate distribution of collected funds as dividends

Anyone may buy a stake in the Horizontal Systems DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless, reliable and transparent manner. Similarly, any capable software developer may become a contractor and a full member of the Horizontal Systems development team.

Horizontal Systems keeps the entire software development workflow including to-do tasks, upcoming milestones, team communication and discussions on Github's public task tracker. Anyone is able to monitor the team, work being done, every single code change, in nearly real-time.

<h2><center>Investors (Governors)</center></h2>

Horizontal Systems DAO shares are represented as HSDAO tokens. Anyone owning HSDAO tokens is automatically a shareholder and able to exercise the influence over the DAO.

The amount of tokens determines the amount of influence token holder has over the company. The investors are the ones who get to split company profits and control the finances. 

As more DApps are relased we aim to integrate monetization features into every decentralized product. The apps will include various extra paid features on top of the standard functionality.

Unlocking these features will cost some money (charged in crypto) that would be directly deposited (in real time) to unchangeable investor-controlled smart contract which is designed to store and distribute profits from all released products.

As we build Horizontal Systems DApps we are releasing several software repositories to the crypto ecosystem enabling developers worldwide to build branded decentralized wallets, exchanges and other blockchain-powered DApps.

The current milestones and progress on each milestone can be seen under the [Projects section](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects) on Github. Note that while the projects may seem unrelated for the most part they are closely interdependent.

<h2><center>Token Sale</center></h2>

The process through which the tokens are sold is called [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained), which was initially proposed by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), a founder of Ethereum blockchain.

Unlike the traditional ICO models, the DAICO model offers significant advantage and guarantees security of invested funds:

- transparent model and nearly zero risk
- backed by open source code
- allows investors to collectively dissolve the company and return the invested funds.
