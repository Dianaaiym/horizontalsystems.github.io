<br/>

Horizontal Systems is a decentralzied autonomous organization, or DAO. It's a self sustainable blockchsin entity that's governed by people and driven by talented software engineers in a decentralized, transparent, immutable, incorruptable manner.

Anyone may buy a stake in the Horizontal Systems DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless, reliable and transparent manner. 

Similarly, any capable software developer may become a contractor and a full member of the Horizontal Systems development team.

Horizontal Systems keeps the entire software development workflow including to-do tasks, upcoming milestones, team communication and discussions on [Github](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/). Anyone is able to monitor the team, work being done, every single code change, in nearly real-time :)

Every single line of code powering Horizontal Systems DAO incl. its products is [public and open-source](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/) providing any software engineer an easy way to verify everything stated above.


DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code used in DAO is open to public for scrutiny. All DAO rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain and operartional prootocols are enforced by digitally coded autinomous smart contracts.


### How It Works

1. shareholders buy a stake in Horizontal Systems DAO via [DAICO fundraising model](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained)
2. shareholders always remain in control of DAO's profits and initially raised funds
3. DAO employs a team of contractors (developers) to build commercial DApps
4. DAO pays contractors team a regular salary from raised funds
5. DApps built by team are free but come with premium in-app features
6. app users can unlock these features by paying using available crypto balance
7. all user payments are collected and stored in DAO's independent smart contracts
8. shareholders initiate distribution of collected funds as dividends
