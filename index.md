Horizontal Systems is an emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that builds censorship-resistant [decentralized apps](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-dapps), known as DApps. Founded by a [team](https://horizontalsystems.io/dao/team) of software engineers, Horizontal Systems seeks talented software engineers to build decentralized applications which operate as decentralized autonomous networks.

### DAO Explained

>_Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself._
>
>_Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code_

The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management. In DAOs, the company governance, finances as well as daily operational protocols are all controlled by and enforced through digitally-coded [Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I0dUL4kpTg), which are usually hosted on [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/dao).


DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code used in DAO is open to public for scrutiny. All DAO rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain.

The DAOs are transparent, immutable and incorruptible!

### How It Works

1. shareholders buy a stake in Horizontal Systems DAO via [DAICO fundraising model](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained)
2. shareholders always remain in control of DAO's profits and initially raised funds
3. DAO employs a team of contractors (developers) to build commercial DApps
4. DAO pays contractors team a regular salary from raised funds
5. DApps built by team are free but come with premium in-app features
6. app users can unlock these features by paying using available crypto balance
7. all user payments are collected and stored in DAO's independent smart contracts
8. shareholders initiate distribution of collected funds as dividends

Anyone may buy a stake in the Horizontal Systems DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless, reliable and transparent manner. Similarly, any capable software developer may become a contractor and a full member of the Horizontal Systems development team.

Horizontal Systems keeps the entire software development workflow including to-do tasks, upcoming milestones, team communication and discussions on Github's public task tracker. Anyone is able to monitor the team, work being done, every single code change, in nearly real-time :)

Every single line of code powering Horizontal Systems DAO incl. its products is [public and open-source](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/) providing any software engineer an easy way to verify everything stated above.
