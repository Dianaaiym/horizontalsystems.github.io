Eternal apps that don't fail and are designed to work indefintely.

Horizontal Systems builds apps that are not dependent on any centrally-managed servers or human personnel and are designed to operare indefinitely. These apps are fully peer-to-peer, enabling users to communicate with each other directly, without any intermediary.

As there are no servers or databases these apps are censorship-resistant and unblockable. 

All sensitive information stored encrypted on a smartphone itself and never leaves it. 

Every single line of code powering these apps is open for public to review and free to reuse. It's all open source [@Github](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/)

We are pioneering this new generation of apps :)
