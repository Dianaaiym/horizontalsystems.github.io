Horizontal Systems is a DAO company that builds decentralized blockchain-powered apps for mainstream users.

It was started by a [team of software engineers](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/people) driven by the shared goal of a just and transparrent world through decentralization.

We build censorship-resistant apps for iOS and Android phones which operate as decentralized autonomous networks. These apps neither depend on any physical entity nor require any servers to run on. They're designed to remain functional even if there is not a single server or a person to operate them.

## A "DAO" Company 

Horizontal Systems is a **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganization (DAO). The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management.

The company finances as well as governance and operational protocols are all controlled by and enforced through Smart Contracts on Ethereum blockchain. In plain terms, these are uncontrollable digital programs that permanently live on blockchain and work exactly as programmed, no exceptions.

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all [underlying code](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/) is open to public for scrutiny. Moreover, all of the rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain. 

This makes DAOs fully transparent, immutable and incorruptible!

> Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself. Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code

## The dApps

Apart from keeping things decentralized we take a perfectionist approach to software development process by pursuing the best practices. 

We spend a lot of time designing the right architecture for each of the apps so that users get an outstanding user experience while keeping the possibility of bugs at minimum and having an easily extendable code. Such approach allows us to move fast and ultimately perform much more efficiently when compared to traditional software companies.

> Now, in software, and it used ot be the case in hardware, the difference between the average software developer and the best is 50:1; Maybe even 100:1. Very few things in life are like this...

While there are 14 of us working in the development team at this point we are fairly confident that we easily outperform a 50+ people companies working in the field. Infact, we believe that having a compact and yet comprehensive team is one of our core strengths.

## Invest in Horizontal Systems

Horizontal Systems DAO shares are represented as HSYS tokens. The amount of tokens determines the amount of influence token holder has over the company.

The process through which the tokens are sold is called [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained), which was initially proposed by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), a founder of Ethereum blockchain. 

DAICO offers a digital investment model with controlled risk, that is ideal for launching DAOs.   In simple terms, the Horizontal Systems DAO consists of three entities: The company, investors and development team.   

Anyone can become an investor and get a say in company matters. Similarly, any software developer can apply to become a member of the development team, regardless of location. Provided that majority of team reach consensus the applicant becomes a full member of the team.  

- The Company outlines permanent engagement rules at the very beginning. Once deployed no one can change them.
- The Investors collectively get absolute control over the raised capital and company’s cashflow. They pay the bills and control team's salary for the development work. They’re even able to dissolve the company, if there is a need for it.  
- The Development Team controls the software development aspects and in return receives salary from investor-controlled funds.

We aim to integrate monetization features into every decentralized product we develop. The apps will include various extra paid features on top of the standard functionality. Unlocking these features will cost some money (charged in crypto) that would be directly deposited (in real time) to unchangeable investor-controlled smart contract which is designed to store and distribute profits from all released products.
