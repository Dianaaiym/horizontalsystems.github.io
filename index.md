Horizontal Systems is a publicly owned company that builds decentralized apps for mainstream users. It was founded by a [team of software engineers](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/people) driven by the shared goal of a just and transparrent world through decentralization.

The company builds censorship-resistant financial apps for iOS/Android which operate as decentralized autonomous networks. These apps neither depend on any physical entity nor require any servers to run on. They're designed to remain fair and functional even if there is not a single server or a person to operate them.

It should be noted, that this website is primarily for tech investors looking for a safe investment into a **true** blockchain company and for talented software developers looking to make a difference doing what they love while earning a good salary.

## A "DAO" Company

> Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself. Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code

Horizontal Systems is a **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganization (DAO). The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management.

The company finances, structure as well as governance and operational protocols are all controlled by and enforced through Smart Contracts on [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/dao). In plain terms, these are uncontrollable digital programs that permanently live on blockchain and work exactly as programmed, no exceptions.

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all [underlying code](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/) is open to public for scrutiny. Moreover, all of the rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain. 

This makes DAOs fully transparent, immutable and incorruptible!


## Horizontal Systems DAO

Horizontal Systems is a public company where anyone can buy a stake in the company and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless manner. It's open for all, impossible to shut down, and can't go offline. 

Similarly, any smart software developer may apply to become a paid member of the core development team, provided that majority of the team reach consensus via team vote the developer becomes a full member of the team.  

By taking Horizontal Systems public we are aiming to establish a first commercial DAO company which run by independent investors and developed by independent libertarian developers from all over the world.


### Structure and Business Model

1. independent investors buy stake in the company via [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained) fundraising model
2. investors control company finances and raised funds
3. the dev team gets paid a salary from raised funds on a regular basis 
4. dev team creates financial dApps for mainstream users
5. the dApps are free but come with premium in-app features
6. regular app users pay with crypto to unlock those features
7. all such payments are collected and stored in independent smart contract.
8. investors initiate dividends to distribute dividends

The above company structure, workflow and governance rules are clearly defined in our open-source [DAICO Smart Contracts](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/daico-smart-contracts) library. That library shows the actual implementation of the DAO.

Below you may find a comprehensive diagram outlining the entire company structure and functions available to each party.

You may easily verify that Horizontal Systems DAO implemented using the same library by looking up the smart contracts Horizontal Systems DAO on the Ethereum blockchain.

- HS DAO contract (token contract address)
- HS DAICO contract (token sale conrtact adderss)
- HS Development Team contract
- HS Investors contract

Every single line of code we have is open source and gives any responsible investor or developer a way to actually verify every single word mentioned on this website. Infact, we enocurage you to do exactly that!

### Current Products

The dApps

Apart from keeping things decentralized we take a perfectionist approach to software development process by pursuing the best practices. 

We spend a lot of time designing the right architecture for each of the apps so that users get an outstanding user experience while keeping the possibility of bugs at minimum and having an easily extendable code. Such approach allows us to move fast and ultimately perform much more efficiently when compared to traditional software companies.

> Now, in software, and it used ot be the case in hardware, the difference between the average software developer and the best is 50:1; Maybe even 100:1. Very few things in life are like this...

> Steve Jobs, The Lost Interview

While there are 14 of us working in the development team at this point we are fairly confident that we easily outperform a 50+ people companies working in the field. Infact, we believe that having a compact and yet comprehensive team is one of our core strengths.

## Invest in Horizontal Systems

Horizontal Systems DAO shares are represented as HSYS tokens. The amount of tokens determines the amount of influence token holder has over the company.

The process through which the tokens are sold is called [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained), which was initially proposed by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), a founder of Ethereum blockchain. 

DAICO offers a digital investment model with controlled risk, that is ideal for launching DAOs.   In simple terms, the Horizontal Systems DAO consists of three entities: The company, investors and development team.   

Anyone can become an investor and get a say in company matters. Similarly, any software developer can apply to become a member of the development team, regardless of location. Provided that majority of team reach consensus the applicant becomes a full member of the team.  

- The Company outlines permanent engagement rules at the very beginning. Once deployed no one can change them.
- The Investors collectively get absolute control over the raised capital and company’s cashflow. They pay the bills and control team's salary for the development work. They’re even able to dissolve the company, if there is a need for it.  
- The Development Team controls the software development aspects and in return receives salary from investor-controlled funds.

We aim to integrate monetization features into every decentralized product we develop. The apps will include various extra paid features on top of the standard functionality. Unlocking these features will cost some money (charged in crypto) that would be directly deposited (in real time) to unchangeable investor-controlled smart contract which is designed to store and distribute profits from all released products.
