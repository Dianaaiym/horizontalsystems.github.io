Horizontal Systems is an emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
that builds decentralized apps (aka dApps) for mainstream users. 
It was founded by a team of software engineers fascinated by the DAO concept and driven by the shared 
goal of a just and transparrent world through decentralization.

Horizontal Systems builds censorship-resistant financial applications for iOS and Android devices 
which operate as decentralized autonomous networks.

These dApps neither depend on any physical entity nor require any servers to run on.
They are designed to remain online and functional even if there 
is not a single server or a person to operate them.

  <h3>A "DAO" Company</h3>
</center>

With Horizontal Systems DAO we are establishing a first commercial DAO company which run by independent investors and developed by independent developers from all over the world. 

The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management.

> _Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself. Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code_

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all [underlying code](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/) is open to public for scrutiny. Moreover, all of the rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain.

The company finances, structure as well as governance and operational protocols are all controlled by and enforced through Smart Contracts on [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/dao). 

This makes DAOs fully transparent, immutable and incorruptible!

  <h3>Horizontal Systems "DAO" Structure</h3>
</center>

Anyone may buy a stake in the DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless manner. Similarly, any capable software developer may apply to become a compensated and anonymouse member of the core development team, provided that majority of the team reach consensus via public team vote the developer may become a full equally-compensated member of the team.

1. independent investors buy stake in the HS DAO via [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained) fundraising model
2. investors are able to control company finances and raised funds
3. the dev team gets paid a salary from raised funds on a regular basis 
4. dev team creates financial dApps for mainstream users
5. the dApps are free but come with premium in-app features
6. regular app users pay with crypto to unlock those features
7. all such payments are collected and stored in independent smart contract
8. investors initiate distribution of dividends


You may easily verify that Horizontal Systems DAO and the token sale implemented the way shown above by looking up the underlying smart contracts for [Horizontal Systems DAO](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/daico-smart-contracts) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Every single line of code we have is open-source and gives any regular software developer a way to verify every single word mentioned on this website. Infact, we enocurage you to do exactly that!

- HS DAO contract: (token contract address)
- HS DAICO contract: (token sale conrtact adderss)
- HS Team contract: contract address
- HS Investors contract: contract address

**Note: The contracts are going to be available on Ethereum Blockchain after the token sale has been launched. The token sale will be launched after the very first product, a [BANK Wallet](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/2), is live.**
