Horizontal Systems is a consumer-oriented software company that builds decentralized Blockchain-powered applications for mainstream audience.

Driven by the idea of a just and transparrent world through decentralization we are building censorship-resistant native iOS/Android apps which operate as decentralized autonomous networks.

We are a {team of software engineers](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/people) building the very first decentralized apps aimed at mainstream audience. The apps we build neither depend on any physical entity nor require any servers to run on. These apps are designed to remain online and operational even if there is not a single person willing to operate them, not even the Horizontal Systems itself!


## Also a "DAO" Company 

Apart from building decentrazlied apps we are also a Decentralized Company as well. Just like the apps we build our company is designed to function as decentralized autonomous entity. It's impossible for someone to shut it down, take it offline, or to somehow restrict its operations.

Horizontal Systems is a first of a kind **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganization where anyone can buy a stake in the company and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless manner. DAOs aim to digitally hard-code all the operational rules and therefore work exactly as programmed, no exceptions.

> Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself. Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code.

The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management. This notion became a practical reality with the emergence of Ethereum and its Smart Contracts technology which provide a reliable way to define and enforce company governance and operational protocols.

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone. Moreover, all of the rules and financial transactions are recorded in the Blockchain. 

This makes DAOs fully transparent, immutable and incorruptible.
