Horizontal Systems is an emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that builds censorship-resistant [decentralized apps](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-dapps), known as DApps. Founded by a team of software engineers, Horizontal Systems seeks talented software engineers to build decentralized applications which operate as decentralized autonomous networks.

### DAO Explained

>_Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself._

>_Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code_

The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management. In DAOs, the company governance, finances as well as daily operational protocols are all controlled by and enforced through digitally-coded [Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I0dUL4kpTg), which are usually hosted on [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/dao).


DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code used in DAO is open to public for scrutiny. All DAO rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain.

The DAOs are transparent, immutable and incorruptible!

### How It Works

1. Anyone holding a Horizontal Systems DAO token conasidered a governor. 
2. Governors control of DAO's profits and initially raised funds.
3. DAO employs a team of contractors (developers) building commercial DApps
4. Contractors/team receive a regular salary from DAO
5. Profits collected by DApps are stored in DAO's smart contracts
8. Governors initiate distribution of collected funds as dividends

Anyone may buy a stake in the Horizontal Systems DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless, reliable and transparent manner. Similarly, any capable software developer may become a contractor and a full member of the Horizontal Systems development team.


Every single line of code powering Horizontal Systems DAO and its products is [public and open-source](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/) providing any software engineer an easy way to verify everything stated above. In fact, we encourage you to do exactly that!
