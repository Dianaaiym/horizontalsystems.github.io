Horizontal Systems is a company that builds fully decentralized Blockchain-powered applications for mainstream audience.

We are a [team of software engineers](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/people) driven by the idea of a just and transparrent world through decentralization. We build censorship-resistant apps for iOS and Android phones which operate as decentralized autonomous networks.

The apps we build neither depend on any physical entity nor require any servers to run on. The apps are designed to remain functional even if there is not a single person willing to operate them, not even the Horizontal Systems itself!


## A "DAO" Company 

Apart from building decentralized apps (aka dApps) we are also a **Decentralized Company** as well. Just like the apps we build our company is also designed to function as a decentralized, independent, autonomous entity. It's impossible for someone to shut it down, take it offline, or to somehow restrict its operations.

Horizontal Systems is a first of a kind **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganization where anyone can buy a stake in the company and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless manner. DAOs aim to digitally hard-code all the operational rules and therefore work exactly as programmed, no exceptions.

> Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself. Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code.... [via CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-dao#how-daos-work)

The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management. This notion became a practical reality with the emergence of Ethereum and its Smart Contracts technology which provide a reliable way to define and enforce company governance and operational protocols.

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone. Moreover, all of the rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain. 

This makes DAOs fully transparent, immutable and incorruptible.

## The dApps

Apart from keeping things decentralized we take a perfectionist approach to software development process by pursuing the best pracices. 

We spend a lot of time designing the right architecture for each of the apps so that users get an outstanding user experience while keeping the possibility of bugs at minimum and having an easily extendable code. Such approach allows us to move fast and ultimately perform much more efficiently when compared to traditional software companies.

> Now, in software, and it used ot be the case in hardware, the difference between the average software developer and the best is 50:1; Maybe even 100:1. Very few things in life are like this...

While there are 14 of us working in the development team at this point we are fairly confident that we easily outperform a 50+ people companies working in the field. Infact, we believe that having a compact and yet comprehesnive team is one of our core strenghts.

## Invest in Horizontal Systems

Horizontal Systems DAO consists of HSYS digital shares (tokens). The amount of shares determines the amount influence level token holder has over the company.

The process through which the tokens are sold is called [DAICO](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained), which was initially proposed by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), a founder of Ethereum blockchain. 

DAICO offers a nearly zero-free digital investment model called that is ideal for launching DAOs.   In simple terms, the Horizontal Systems DAO consists of three entities. The company, investors and development team.   

Any one can become investor and get a say in company matters. Similarly, any software developer can apply to become a member of the development team, regardless of location. Provided that majority of team reach consensus the applicant becomes a full member of the team.  

- The Company outlines permanent engagement rules at the very beginning. Once deployed no one can change them.
- The Investors collectively get absolute control over the raised capital and company’s cashflow. They pay the bills and control team's salary for the development work. They’re even able to dissolve the company, if there is a need for it.  
- The Development Team controls the software development aspects and in-return receive salary from investor-controlled funds.

We aim to integrate moneazation features into every decentralized product we develop. The apps will includes various extra paid features on top of the standard functionality. Unlocking these features will cost some money (charged in crypto) that would  deposited (in real time) to unchangeable investor-controlled smart contract which is designed to store profits from all released products.
