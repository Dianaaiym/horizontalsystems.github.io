Horizontal Systems is an emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that builds censorship-resistant [decentralized apps](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-dapps), known as DApps.

Initially founded by a [team](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-team) of software engineers, Horizontal Systems attracts talented software engineers to build DApps for smartphones which operate as decentralized autonomous networks.


### DApps Explained

A DApp is a type of apps that neither depends on some physical entity nor requires any servers to run on.

The true DApps are designed to remain online and functional indefinitely, even if there is not a single server or a person to operate them. These DApps are trully independent, in all aspects!


### DAO Explained

The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management.

>_Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself._

>_Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code_

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code used in DAO is open to public for scrutiny. All DAO rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain.

In DAOs, the company governance, finances as well as daily operational protocols are all controlled by and enforced through digitally-coded [Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I0dUL4kpTg) on [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/dao).

The DAOs are transparent, immutable and incorruptible!

  <h2>Horizontal Systems DAO</h2>
</center>

With Horizontal Systems DAO we are launching the first independent commercial DAO company which is governed by a pool of independent shareholders and driven by software developers worldwide.

### How It Works
 
1. shareholders [buy a stake](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-dapps) in Horizontal Systems DAO via [DAICO fundraising model](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained)
2. shareholders always remain in control of DAO's profits and initially raised funds
3. DAO employs a team of contractors (developers) to build commercial DApps
4. DAO pays contractors team a regular salary from raised funds
5. DApps built by team are free but come with premium in-app features
6. app users can unlock these features by paying using available crypto balance
7. all user payments are collected and stored in DAO's independent smart contracts
8. shareholders initiate distribution of collected funds as dividends

Anyone may buy a stake in the Horizontal Systems DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless, reliable and transparent manner. Similarly, any capable software developer may become a contractor and a full member of the Horizontal Systems development team.

Every single line of code Horizontal Systems has is [public and open-source](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/) providing any software engineer an easy way to verify everything stated above. In fact, we encOurage you to do exactly that!

### Everything Is Public

When designing the Horizontal Systems DAO the key element was to guarantee the transparency for all involved parties. And while the open-source code reveals what's in the code it falls short when it comes to the transparency of the actual software development process and workflow. 

Horizontal Systems keeps the entire software development workflow including to-do tasks, upcoming milestones, team communication and discussions on Github's public task tracker. Anyone is able to monitor the team, work being done, every single code change, in nearly real-time.

You don't have to take our word for it, but actually see it yourself.

- Software Repositories : (github.com/horizontalsystems)[https://github.com/horizontalsystems]


#### Key Software Repositories:

These core repositories are the primary building blocks for the upcoming projects and DApps we are planning to release in the coming months. 

While we built these repositories specifically for the Horizontal Systems DApps they are also being released to global blockchain developer community to enable independent developers worldwide to build branded decentralized wallets, exchanges and other blockchain-powered DApps.

#### Upcoming Projects / Milestones:

The current milestones and progress on each milestone can be seen under the [Projects section](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects) on Github. Note that while the projects may seem unrelated for the most part they are closely interdependent. 

The BANK Wallet is the first product and the first milestone as it's a prerequisite for launching the other projects like DAO Platform or the Decentralized Crypto-to-Crypto Exchange. 

1. Launch Bank Wallet App : [github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/2  ](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/2  )
2. Launch DAO Platform:  [github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/3  ](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/3  )
3. Lunch DEX (Decentralized Exchange): [github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/4](https://github.com/orgs/horizontalsystems/projects/4)
