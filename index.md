Horizontal Systems is an emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
that [builds decentralized apps](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-dapps), known as DApps.

Founded by a [team](https://horizontalsystems.io/hs-team) of software engineers Horizontal Systems builds censorship-resistant financial apps which operate as decentralized autonomous networks.

These DApps neither depend on any physical entity nor require any servers to run on. They are designed to remain online and functional even if there is not a single server or a person to operate them. 

Real DApps are trully independent, in all aspects!

  <h3>DAO Explained</h3>
</center>

The main idea behind DAO is establishing a company that can be fully functional without hierarchical management.

>_Imagine a vending machine that not only takes money from you and gives you a snack in return but also uses that money to automatically re-order the goods. This machine also orders cleaning services and pays its rent all by itself. Moreover, as you put money into that machine, you and its other users have a say in what snacks it will order and how often should it be cleaned. It has no managers, all of those processes were pre-written into code_

DAOs are required by their nature to be open source so that all underlying code is open to public for scrutiny. Moreover, all of the rules and financial transactions are recorded in the public blockchain.

The company finances, structure as well as governance and operational protocols are all controlled by and enforced through digitally-coded public Smart Contracts on [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/dao). 

DAOs are transparent, immutable and incorruptible!

Anyone may buy a stake in the DAO and take part in shaping company's future in a trustless manner. Similarly, any capable software developer may become a full member of the development team, provided that team majority reach consensus.


#### How It Works
 
1. shareholders buy a stake in the Horizontal Systems using [DAICO model](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-daico-explained)
2. shareholders control company profits and raised funds
3. contractors (development team) works on creating DApps for mainstream users
4. contractors get a monthly salary from raised funds
5. the DApps are free but come with premium in-app features
6. users pay with crypto balance to unlock premium features
7. all user payments are collected and stored in independent smart contract
8. investors initiate distribution of collected funds as dividends

You may easily verify that Horizontal Systems DAO is implemented the way shown above by looking up the underlying smart contracts for [Horizontal Systems DAO](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Every single [line of code](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/) we have is open-source and gives any software developer an easy way to verify everything mentioned above. Infact, we enocurage you to do exactly that!
