Horizontal Systems DAO exists to build censorship-resistant financial DApps for mainstream audience. 

With every DApp the Horizontal Systems DAO aims to disrupt a major sector of the rusty financial ecosystem and utimately deliver a significantly better value proposition to the end user.

The DApps we develop make use of full potential of blockchain technology and therefore have the qualities of trully decentralized applications.

1. **Independent**: do not require any entity to function
2. **Decentralized**: without centrally-managed servers
3. **Censorship-resistant**: no one can block or restrict the app
4. **Cryptographically-secure**: only the user controls his/her data
5. **Hack-proof**: no servers or databases to hack

Apart from pursuing known best practices in blockchain engineering we strive to achieve excellence in other no less critical aspects of the software engineering in order to deliver the state of the art DApps.

5. Open-source: 100% of the apps' code is public and open to review
6. Smart software architecture: makes it easy to grow and add new app features
7. Efficient architechture: work fast on any device
8. Well-designed interface: designed and simplified, down to the minor detail
