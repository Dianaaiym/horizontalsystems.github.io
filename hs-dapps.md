Apart from keeping things decentralized we take a perfectionist approach to software development process by pursuing the best practices. 

We spend a lot of time designing the right architecture for each of the apps so that users get an outstanding user experience while keeping the possibility of bugs at minimum and having an easily extendable code. 

Such approach allows us to move fast and ultimately perform much more efficiently when compared to traditional software companies.

These core repositories are the primary building blocks for the upcoming projects and DApps we are planning to release in the coming months. 

While we built these repositories specifically for the Horizontal Systems DApps they are also being released to global blockchain developer community to enable independent developers worldwide to build branded decentralized wallets, exchanges and other blockchain-powered DApps.
