Horizontal Systems DAO exists to build censorship-resistant financial DApps for mainstream audience.

### DApps Explained

A DApp stands for Decentralized Application and usually refers to a type of apps that are not dependent on some centrally managed corporate servers. The true DApps are designed to remain online and functional indefinitely, even if there is not a single server or a person to operate them.

With every DApp the Horizontal Systems DAO aims to disrupt a major sector of the financial ecosystem and ultimately deliver a significantly better value proposition to the end user.

The DApps we develop make use of full potential of blockchain technology and therefore have the qualities of truly decentralized applications.

1. **Independent**: do not require any entity to function
2. **Decentralized**: without centrally-managed servers
3. **Censorship-resistant**: no one can block or restrict the app
4. **Cryptographically-secure**: only the user controls his/her data
5. **Hack-proof**: no servers or databases to hack

Apart from pursuing known best practices in blockchain engineering we strive to achieve excellence in other no less critical aspects of the software engineering in order to deliver the state of the art DApps.

5. **Open-source**: 100% of the apps' code is public and open to review
6. **Flexible architecture**: easy to extend and add new app features
7. **Efficient architecture**: fast performance on any device
8. **Well-designed**: designed and simplified, down to the minor detail
